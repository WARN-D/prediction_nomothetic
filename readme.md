# Info

## Main Direcotories:

- docs: Contains the bookdown site material used to generate the [Github page](https://warn-d.github.io/prediction_nomothetic/introduction.html).
- figures: High resolution PNG figures generated by R. Note that the SVG figures are not included due to size limitations. 
- renv: R environment information
- scripts: Code used in the paper. Includes the code provided in the notebook, and a subfolder of code used on the ALICE HPC Cluster.

## Omitted:

We additionally omit some directories as follows:

- data: We will make WARN-D data available on the WARN-D project hub (https://osf.io/frqdv/) when all data are collected, cleaned, and de-identified. 
- results: Result files are too large to upload directly, and are therefore made available on [OSF](https://osf.io/jf53q/files).
