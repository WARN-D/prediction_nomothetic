# Introduction

This is the notebook accompanying the publication **Integrating ecological momentary and passive sensing data to improve depression severity prediction: insights from the WARN-D study**. In it, two sections run in R can be found. Part 1 contains code used to run the pre-processing on some of the data, and then the descriptive statistics. In this chapter, we also format data in a way to make it work with `pyhton`, which we then use for the main portion of the machine learning (ML) analysis. Following the ML analysis, we bring back the data to R and produce tables and figures that we later use in publication.
